                Make the Alfredo Sauce:
                In the same skillet used for the chicken, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the minced garlic and saut√© for about 1 minute until fragrant.
                Pour in the heavy cream and bring it to a gentle simmer. Stir frequently.
                Gradually add the Parmesan cheese, stirring until it's melted and the sauce is smooth. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
