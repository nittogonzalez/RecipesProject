# RecipesProject
Hello guys
thsi project will put into practice the HTML basics I have learned throughout the odin project, I have taken a long break from the Odin Project mostly because I've been putting it off but I have also been busy with life.
This Project will require me to create a website with links that redirect the visitor to multiple other recipes, I will be able to practice basic HTML syntax and how to embed images and links onto my websites
